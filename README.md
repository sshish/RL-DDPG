# RL-DDPG
PyTorch implementation of DDPG, tested on OpenAI Gym environments.

learns to solve the LunarLanderContinuous-v2 task in about 300 episodes

run the notebook (main.ipynb)

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** (including the readme)

## Requirements
* PyTorch
* CUDA support (can be disabled by editing the few lines in the code that contain `cuda`)
* OpenAI Gym
* the `hiddenlayer` python module for dynamic plots
